        <p class="blogtext">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the 
            printing and typesetting industry. Lorem 
            Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an 
            unknown printer took a galley of type and 
            scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
            It has survived not only five centuries, 
            but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was 
            popularised in the 1960s with the release 
            of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
            passages, and more recently with desktop 
            publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
            including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
