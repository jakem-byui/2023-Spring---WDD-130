        <p>Hi, I'm Jake Matheson!</p>
        <p>I'm originally from Lousiville, KY, USA! I moved to Portland, OR for work a little over a year ago.
          My major is Applied Technology.
        </p>
        <p>My wife, Kelsey, and I recently got married in Nov 2022! I love spending time with her watching movies,
          playing Mario Cart, and board games, or exploring the great Pacific Northwest!</p>
        <p>I have a passion (I don't think that's too extreme a word) for chicken tenders. I recently had some
          delicious chicken tenders at a placecalled "Fat Shack" in Eugene, OR. If you're ever passing
          through, they're worth stopping by! Deep-fried Oreos, unique sandwiches and burgers, great shakes, and
          wings... What more could you ask for?!?!</p>

        <p>I'm excited to get to know everyone!</p>
